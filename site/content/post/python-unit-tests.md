We have just been onboard with Python recently as our requirements with using AWS Lambdas and API Gateway to provide REST APIs to our users as well as integration with UI part. As Lambda is infamous for its century-long cold start, especially for compiled languages like Java or C#, Python becomes a suitable choice for our time-sensitive API builds for its ultra-low start time. This post will talk about my learning  and experimenting experience during this short time period.
My first interaction with Python dated back to the time when I still worked as Cerner. We used an implementation of Python 2 called Jython to automate our process of configuring and deploying artifacts on IBM WebSphere App Server. Since we wrote Python as scripts, I used to see it as a procedure language and not until a year back when I helped one of my friends with her Python homework, I came to know Python fully supports object oriented paradigm.
