I wrestled a little bit with Netlify CMS today as it could not list the pictures in the Gitlab repo. This seems to be a bug from Netlify codes but strangely no one reported this on their Github repo. I ended up moving my codes to Github instead and the issue disappeared. Looks like Netlify only tested their codes against Github.
