I recently moved my blog from Wordpress free tier into Netlify. It has been a short time for me to try static blogging, but the experience so far has been great. Netlify is totally free but breezing fast and has lots of premium features that we can only expect to pay a great deal of money if we use other VPS, such as automatic build and deployment for codes from git repository, custom domain, and free TLS certificate registration with Let's Encrypt. Another great feature that Netlify provides is its broad CDNs that helps the website to be loaded very quick across the globe.

Enough for the first post. I'm still playing around and tweaking up the blog to make it looks more friendly, and have necessary tools to facility my blogging experience.

And one more cool thing: I'm using Netlify CMS to write this post. It is kinds of cool so check it out if you like to use freebies for your website :)
