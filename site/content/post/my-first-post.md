I recently moved my blog from Wordpress free tier into Netlify, a static blogging service provider. It has been a short time for me, but the experience so far has been great. Netlify is totally free but breezing fast and has lots of premium features that we can only expect to pay a great deal of money if we are to use other VPS, among them are automatic build and deployment from git repository, custom domain, and free TLS certificate registration with Let's Encrypt. Another great feature that Netlify provides is its broad CDNs which help websites to be loaded very quickly across the globe.

Enough for the first post. I'm still playing around and tweaking up the website to make it look more friendly, and be equipped with necessary tools to facility my blogging experience.

And one more cool thing: I'm using Netlify CMS to write this post. It is kinds of cool to write a page without the need to think about all of the markup and markdown (if you are as lazy as me to learn about all these cool stuff), so check it out if you like to use freebies for your website :)
